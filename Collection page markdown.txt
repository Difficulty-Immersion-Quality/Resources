### &#x20;      My Other Collections:

- [DIQ Expanded](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y0iw7z) A supplemental collection for [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv) focused on adding further build options.
- [DIQ Armoury](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y7cdjf) A supplemental collection for [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv) focused on adding more items!
- [DIQ Extras](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/k3zucg) A supplemental collection for [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv) focused on adding customisation options.
- [BG3 Essentials](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/1asizr) A basic collection comprised of the building blocks for most mod lists, Native mods, Script Extender, UI Improvements etc. (**Note:** These mods are already included in [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv).)
- [DIQ Archive](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/yif5lj) Where I lay mods to rest after removal from the other collections. (**Note:** Not for general use.)

***

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE:** If you want to mod a game you must be willing to **read**, **learn** and **commit** some time to it. Even when using a collection in its default state you should be attempting to understand the **what**, **why** and **how**.

- ‚úÖYou **must** **read** and **follow instructions** to achieve a successful install **and** to successfully update!ü§ì
- ‚ùìIf you have a general question it's likely **already answered** on this page.üí°
- ‚ùåDo not seek support regarding the collection outside of my [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) or this collection page, the folks spending their free time helping in the [Larian Studios Discord](https://discord.gg/larianstudios) don't need it wasted, there's enough people building their own non-functional mod lists in there.
- ‚úÖYou must use both [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) and [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases) for this collection.‚öôÔ∏è
- ‚ùóÔ∏è**New games only**, don't install this collection for an existing playthrough, especially an existing modded playthrough.
- ‚ùåYou **cannot** use other curator's collections alongside this one, stuff will **break**!üí•
- ‚ùåOnly **big brained**, **longtime mod users**, or **very patient folk** should attempt to customise this list!üß†
- ‚ùåI do not recommend playing **Honour Mode**, it's bad enough in vanilla where bugs still exist, pile hundreds of mods on top and you're really gambling. BG3 is a long game, previous saves are a useful commodity.‚ùóÔ∏è
- üéÆA number of mods are only relevant for **keyboard & mouse**, controllers will work just fine but **K\&B is recommended**.
- ‚úÖYou can earn **achievements** with this collection installed thanks to [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se)!üèÜ
- ‚úçüèªMost mods are **not translated** to languages other than **English**, some comprehension of **English** is basically **required**.
- ‚úÖA decent portion of the collection's size is found in the optional mods. Using ***Symlinks*** through [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) saves some space.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è[Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) can fail to do its job sometimes, other issues can also occur though it's primarily user error. There is plenty of information under the ***3: Troubleshooting Guides***‚ö°Ô∏èsection.

> I started Playing the original Baldur's Gate when I was 9 years old, have been a fan of CRPGs ever since, and played many tabletop RPGs with a preference towards grimdark settings. Naturally, this collection is targeted at players with a similar background to me.ü§ì
>
> I try to keep the collection living up to its name, combat should bring you a challenge, your immersion should be enhanced, and both the quality of life and overall quality of the mods should bring you an elevated gaming experience.üôè

> I'm consistently patching and working on my own mods, learning and implementing all of this is incredibly time consuming. A lot goes into this pet project, all contributions to my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/baldursgoonsack) are greatly appreciated!üî•

However, do not neglect all of the information I have already provided.

<details><summary>üíªVideo guide  - not a full replacement for reading</summary>
# I still **HIGHLY** recommend following along with written guides for further clarity and updated information.

Consider this video complimentary, it's not a full replacement.\
PLEASE READ! READ! READ!
========================

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u67KMwlfQY
</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èsystem Prerequisites  - step #0</summary>
- Mac operating systems (OS) are not supported **PERIOD** due to lack of support from [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) and game updates. Windows 10/11 or Linux systems only, all I know about Linux is the video below so I cannot offer advice for setting up the collection on a Linux OS.

<details><summary>‚ùìGuide for linux from lina</summary>
1. to all of the insane people trying to run this shit on linux here's a tip for you: when you're pointing vortex to the game on steam it has no idea that the actual mods folder is in the corresponding proton wineprefix for baldur's gate 3 and you have to symlink it manually in the vortex wineprefix
2. this is presuming that you're running vortex off its own wineprefix which you should be doing through say lutris
3. so the command would be `ln -s $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1086940/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Larian\ Studios/Baldur\'s\ Gate\ 3/ $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/users/user/AppData/Local/Larian\ Studios/Baldur\'s\ Gate\ 3` or something to this extent change the wineprefix and username paths to what corresponds to your system
4. this step has to happen before vortex starts managing baldurs gate 3
5. and you have to do the same thing with bg3mm but it's easier with bg3mm you add this string `  "DocumentsFolderPathOverride": "Z:\\home\\<user>\\.steam\\steam\\steamapps\\compatdata\\1086940\\pfx\\drive_c\\users\\steamuser\\AppData\\Local\\Larian Studios\\Baldur's Gate 3\\",` to `Data\settings.json`
</details>

- Do not use [WeMod](https://www.wemod.com) or [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org) with your modded BG3, there's been a few occurrences of save instability correlated with use of these programs. For cheating and debug needs use [EasyCheat with in-game UI (MCM)(SE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9827) and [The Debug Book](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2119), both included in the collection.\
  **Note:** The above mods are not foolproof and can also damage saves depending on how they're used.\
  ![](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/student-using-formula-math-sheet-600nw-1490072507.jpg)
- Make sure you're prepared to only use [NTFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/ntfs-overview) formatted [Solid State Drives (SSD)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/all-about-ssd-hdd-and-storage-types-9c6c7c59-7d1c-4611-9ba9-676d53cc0ff1) as the storage device(s) for your modded install.\
  This is primarily so [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) can actually deploy the mods, if your drive is formatted to FAT or anything else it will likely result in the collection not functioning.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySm\_ERcVUlk

- As a general rule of them you should consider Larian's **recommended** specs as this collection's **minimum** specs, however you will need additional storage and Random-access Memory (RAM) on top of that. My recommended RAM is 32GB+ of dual channel memory, unusual configurations with 24GB+ will likely be completely fine but it's nice to have some head room.\
  \
  To play the collection with 16GB of RAM you'll want to be getting the most out of your hardware, have your system only running required processes and the game itself.\
  \
  The GB size listed at the top of the collection page includes optional mods, but the mods are **stored twice** on your system, once in the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Staging*** folder and a second time as `.zip` file archives in the ***Download*** folder. On the plus side using ***Symlink Deployment*** in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) as your ***Deployment Method*** you can set the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Staging*** and ***Download*** folders to a different drive from your game installation.\
  \
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/FsFXx35D/Screenshot-2024-08-27-011852.png)
- If you're using 16GB or less you'll likely end up relying on your [Page File](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/introduction-to-the-page-file) (virtual memory) which will hinder performance, and is not healthy for Solid State Drives (SSDs) when used long-term; it's only harmful if the drive is actually accessed as RAM, the setting being enabled by itself is harmless.\
  \
  Your [Page File](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/introduction-to-the-page-file) (virtual memory) should be on the same storage device as your operating system e.g: drive (C:). This is 100% non-negotiable if you don't have adequate RAM, you will experience crashes, you may not even reach the main menu.\
  \
  For some reason Windows will not allocate virtual memory from other drives to the game's process, if you have more information on this conundrum please share it with me.

- You'll need to be able to view hidden files to easily access appdata folders etc.\
  1\. Open ***File Explorer*** from the taskbar.\
  2\. Select ***View*** > ***Show*** > **Hidden items**.\
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/VkBZykf6/Screenshot-2024-07-17-125957.png)You can also just search "hidden files" and select the following.\
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/xdXmv642/Screenshot-2024-07-17-130344.png)**Bonus:** Seeing file extensions is very handy as well, if you don't have that enabled do it now.\
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/CKp071vx/Screenshot-2024-07-17-130415.png)
- **Bonus:** Here's a [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) guide going over a bunch of stuff to potentially increase performance, a clean PC is a happy PC: [Essential PC Tweaks to Improve Game Performance and Stability](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3016159305)&#x20;

### You're confident that your system is ready for the DIQ?

- Proceed to the next drop down menu: üí°**GAME SETUP - STEP #1.**
</details>

<details><summary>üí°Game setup - step #1</summary>
# Game Setup

1. **Make sure you have a clean game installation!** This is beyond critical. View the guides in‚ö°Ô∏è**Cleaning out your BG3 folders** under ***3: Troubleshooting Guides*** for more information! Alternatively follow [How to Remove All Mods from BG3](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/How-to-remove-mods).\
   Also check out [Steam Community :: Guide :: Cleaning Cache](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018203217), having a **clean install** is about more than just removing mods you were previously using, **I expect people who have never modded their install to also follow these instructions**.![](https://i.postimg.cc/4ykzRZXx/image-2024-06-02-221319767.png)
2. In [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) go to ***Library*** and right click ***Baldur's Gate 3*** select ***Properties*** -> ***Updates*** -> ***Automatic Updates***  set it to ***Only update the game when I launch it***.\
   \
   **Note:** There's a good reason for this, you don't want to update the game prior to collection revisions coming out, if there's an update available without a matching collection revision set [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) into ***Offline Mode*** prior to launching.\
   For more information please read ***2: Updating Guide - Collection & Game Updates***‚ö†Ô∏è.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/zGWhHZQP/image2222222222222222222222222222.png)
3. In [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) go to ***Library*** and right click ***Baldur's Gate 3*** select ***Properties*** -> ***Installed Files*** select ***Verify integrity of game files***.\
   You'll need to wait for this process under your [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) downloads to finish before continuing.\
   **Note:** I've even seen fresh installs get fixed from doing this, you are not above this step!\
   **ALSO:** If you're playing on a downgraded install you cannot ***Verify integrity of game files*** without [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) fetching files from the latest version, so in these cases skip this step. For more information please read ***2: Updating Guide - Collection & Game Updates***‚ö†Ô∏è. \
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/gkjqJ7df/image11111111111111111111.png)
4. Once your install is finished being verified by [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) launch the game to open the ***Larian Launcher*** and select the ***Settings*** cog icon, underneath ***General*** untick the box for ***Enable stats tracking***.![](https://i.postimg.cc/MpFWwv5C/image.png)![](https://i.postimg.cc/cChSbH65/image.png)
5. Again in the ***Larian launcher***, use ***DirectX 11*** instead of ***Vulkan*** as your game's API.\
   This is a general recommendation for performance and mod functionality, I've seen very few users have a better time with ***Vulkan***.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/VLNQNzJm/image.png)
6. New with **Patch #7** is making sure you're not subscribed to any mods through the official mod support, [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3) and the in game mod manager. Better yet, just don't be signed in to [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3) in game at all! \
   \
   You can unsubscribe from mods in game if you're signed into [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3), alternatively, unsubscribe from mods on the [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3) website.\
   **Note:** [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3) and [Larian](https://larian.com) accounts are separate but can be linked.\
   \
   If using the [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3) website just filter by ***My subscriptions***, then click the ***Subscribed*** button to unsubscribe from each mod. This helps to ensure your game won't download a bunch of conflicting mods.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/kXVP4Tfk/Screenshot-2024-11-28-151349.png)
7. Launch into the game at least once on a clean game install to generate files. This includes going through character creation and into the tutorial level to make sure it's working as intended.
8. Under ***Video*** -> ***General*** set ***Display Mode*** to ***Fullscreen***.\
   Unless you're constantly tabbing out of the game It's generally better for performance and stability, if you tab out a lot however it could lead to the opposite, causing infrequent crashing or lead to noticeable performance loss over the course of a long play session.![](https://i.postimg.cc/FFBGjvP9/image.png)
9. Under ***Video*** -> ***Quality*** set ***Animation Level of Detail*** to ***High***, otherwise custom heads and hair will have graphical issues.![](https://i.postimg.cc/HnxZTsBN/image.png)
10. For future convenience, in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) go to ***Library*** and right click ***Baldur's Gate 3*** select ***Properties*** > ***General*** > ***Launch Options*** type ***--skip-launcher***.![](https://i.postimg.cc/G23zjmwp/image33333333333333333333333333333333333.png)
11. Proceed to the next drop down menu: üí°**VORTEX SETUP - STEP #2**.
</details>

<details><summary>üí°Vortex setup - Step #2</summary>
# Vortex Setup

1. Download and install [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/). In the ***Games*** tab, select ***Manage*** on Baldur's Gate 3. The installed path should be recognised automatically, if not point [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) it to the game's install.![](https://i.postimg.cc/nL1GD6zZ/image.png)
2. **WARNING:** DO NOT install [LSLib/Divine Tool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) when prompted by [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), ***Uninstall*** it if need be do not just ***Disable*** it.\
   This tool is needed by [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) to touch the load order, we do not want [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) touching the load order. [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) runs much faster without it.\
   If you needed to uninstall the [LSLib/Divine Tool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) please restart [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) before continuing with the installation.![](https://i.postimg.cc/0ydpH1CK/image.png)
3. **NOTE:** The location of these is very important, putting them inside any of the game's folders will cause serious issues.\
   In [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) under ***Settings*** -> ***Download*** set the ***Downloads Folder*** outside of the game files. Default path is fine, below is where I have mine located.![](https://i.postimg.cc/SxgKYdh3/image.png)
4. In [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) under ***Settings*** -> ***Mods*** set the ***Mod Staging Folder*** outside of the game files. Default path is fine, below is where I have mine located.![](https://i.postimg.cc/4dLnC18p/image.png)
5. In [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) under ***Settings*** -> ***Mods*** set ***Deployment Method*** to ***Symlink Deployment***. \
   ***Hardlink Deployment*** is the default, however ***Symlink Deployment*** is used when the Vortex staging folder is on a different storage device to the game's folders (including both the appdata folder and the game install). ***Symlink Deployment*** will also save you storage space, and is what I choose to use.\
   \
   **WARNING:** Always ***Purge*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) prior to changing ***Deployment Methods***. Otherwise mods already deployed to the game's folders could fail to be managed by [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), and you will have to remove them manually just as you may have done towards the beginning of this guide.![](https://i.postimg.cc/sXZbyjmK/image.png)
6. In [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) under ***Settings*** -> ***Mods*** disable ***Auto export load order***.![](https://i.postimg.cc/brhNbFF0/image.png)
7. In [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) under ***Settings*** -> ***Workarounds*** enable ***Allow Symlinks without elevation***.![](https://i.postimg.cc/G28n2JLF/image.png)
8. In [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) under ***Settings*** -> ***Interface*** -> ***Automation*** -> disable ***Run Vortex when my computer starts*** and ***Deploy Mods when Enabled***.![](https://i.postimg.cc/wTbYYGcW/image.png)
9. **Restart your PC for changes to take affect.**![](https://i.postimg.cc/3JWJGptc/image.png)
10. **REMINDER:** If you uninstalled the [LSLib/Divine Tool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) please restart [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) before continuing with the installation.\
    You will get prompted to install it every time you open [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), just don't get tricked into installing it.![](https://i.postimg.cc/DyqFLgq5/image.png)
11. Proceed to the next drop down menu: üì•**DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION - STEP #3**.
</details>

<details><summary>üì•download & installation - step #3</summary>
# Download & Installation

1. Click the orange ***Add collection*** button at the top of this page to begin the collection download. If you have [Nexus Premium](https://next.nexusmods.com/premium) it will begin downloading all of the mods, if not you will have to click through the download prompts for each mod.![](https://i.postimg.cc/3JwyMVC7/Screenshot-2024-10-27-150805.png)
2. If you get stuck at 100% install/download, mods are missing, or anything weird happens remove the collection (but do not remove the mods, specifically the mod archives) and select ***Add collection*** again. Sometimes downloading hundreds of mods at the push of a button doesn't work right through [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), who could have guessed?\
   View ***3: Troubleshooting Guides*** for more information.![](https://i.postimg.cc/4ykzRZXx/image-2024-06-02-221319767.png)
3. Read over ***5: Optional & Archived Mods*** for information on each optional mod prior installing them, they're optional for a multitude of reasons. You've been warned.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/Nf7gpQPk/image-2024-06-19-034858631.png)\
   This step ensures you won't have question such as: "Why does my Tav have tattoos?" and "How can I remove this chat box?"\
   \
   When downloading optional mods you can hold the CTRL key and left click mods you wish to install, before installing them from the bar at the bottom of your screen. This saves time as [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) will automatically ***Deploy*** whenever an optional mod is installed. \
   **Note:** ***Deployment*** means the mods are being sent to the game files.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/B6z3J72c/Screenshot-2023-11-25-082156.png)
4. Both in the next step and in the future whenever you're making more changes in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) (updating etc.), verifying integrity of game files through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/), or cleaning out your game folders **ALWAYS** ***Purge*** mods prior!\
   **Note:** ***Purging*** removes mods from the game files, it doesn't delete them permanently or harm your install. It increases the efficiency of [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), and reduces the potential for issues to occur.![](https://i.postimg.cc/B6z3J72c/Screenshot-2023-11-25-082156.png)
5. It's at this point you may also wish to install [DIQ Extras](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/k3zucg) (more character customisation) and/or [DIQ Expanded](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y0iw7z) (more build options), and/or [DIQ Armoury](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y7cdjf) (more items) alongside [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv). Just like the previous step explains you should **Purge** mods prior to adding these addon collections.\
   These addon collections can be added at a later date if you just want to try the base collection first.\
   **Note:** The addon collections must be installed into the same ***profile*** in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/xTtmMZ9k/Untitled-design.png)
6. Toggle the column for ***Collection*** on your [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Mods*** page, by clicking the cog icon in the top right. Click the ***Group*** icon for Collection as it will be mandatory for removing old mod files when updating the collection in the future.\
   Also toggle the column for ***Mod Type*** just for easier access to some of the more important mods, such as [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se), [WASD Character Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781), [Native Camera Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945) and [Native Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/944).\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/rmF30Gqn/Screenshot-2024-02-29-115337.png)
7. Make sure to ***Deploy*** mods before moving on from [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/B6z3J72c/Screenshot-2023-11-25-082156.png)
8. Once all of the above looks good, you are ready to begin managing the load order with [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases) ([BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager)). Do not even attempt to use [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) for handling the load order.
9. Proceed to the next drop down menu: üíæ**CONFIGURATION FILES - STEP #4**.
</details>

<details><summary>üíæconfiguration files - step #4</summary>
# CONFIGURATION FILES

üíªWhile [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) based mods will generate their configuration files upon creating/loading a game, I **HIGHLY** recommend you get my customised configuration files; without them you are not truly playing the collection!

1. If you haven't cleaned out old configs please delete the ***Script Extender*** folder inside `C: > (User) > Appdata > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3`
2. You can find the files as an all in one `.zip` under [Difficulty Immersion Quality Collection - Misc Files](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9784)***,*** or get them from my [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks), under ***My Mod Collections*** > ***#***üìë***configs***.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/76MZbxGf/Screenshot-2024-09-05-021405.png)
3. Inside the ***.zip*** folder you will see a folder called ***Script Extender***. Extract the ***.zip*** folder into `C: > (User) > Appdata > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3`
4. Overwrite the existing files and `Script Extender` folder if they exist, if it doesn't exist then extracting the `.zip` will create  it.
5. Proceed to the next drop down menu: üìã**BG3MM LOAD ORDER MANAGEMENT - STEP #5**.

# BG3MM LOAD ORDER MANAGEMENT

**Note:** Before doing the following, have the collection(s) installed, including optional mods which you want to use from [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv), [DIQ Extras](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/k3zucg), [DIQ Expanded](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y0iw7z) and [DIQ Armoury](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y7cdjf).
If you decide to add more optional mods afterwards, or install [DIQ Extras](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/k3zucg) and/or [DIQ Expanded](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y0iw7z) and/or [DIQ Armoury](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y7cdjf) at a later date, you will want to get a fresh load order `.json` file so the mods are placed correctly.

1. Get [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) and extract it to your desktop, or somewhere else nice and easy. Not inside Vortex or game related folders. There is no installation executable, it's good to go upon extraction.\
   \
   **NOTE:** Get the [latest](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases) version [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) for *Patch #7*+, for game versions prior to *Patch #7* use [1.0.10.0](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/tag/1.0.10.0) of [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager).\
   If you've previously been using [1.0.10.0](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/tag/1.0.10.0) please overwrite your [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) install with the [latest](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases) version.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/hvwwB4BB/Screenshot-2024-09-07-113324.png)
2. ***Under Settings*** > ***Preferences*** > ***General*** check that your ***Game Data Path*** and ***Game Executable Path*** are correct, and match where you installed the game.![](https://i.postimg.cc/FHVWQPSf/Screenshot-2024-03-22-041956.png)
3. Get the `REVISION_#.JSON` file from my [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) under ***My Mod Collection*** > ***#***üìë***load-order-json*** or [Difficulty Immersion Quality Collection - Misc Files](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9784) (requires extraction from the `.zip` folder) and place it in `BG3ModManager_Latest\Orders` folder. (You may need to create the `Orders` folder yourself, or select ***Save As*** in [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) to create a load order file and generate the folder.)\
   \
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/5tjDpDQs/image-10.png)![](https://i.postimg.cc/brv8QDjg/Screenshot-2024-03-22-041818.png)![](https://i.postimg.cc/sfGPLsH1/Screenshot-2024-07-30-215439.png)
4. Open or ***Refresh*** [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager).![](https://i.postimg.cc/nzw67dVR/image.png)
5. In [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), select the `.json` file on the ***Mod Order*** drop-down menu. Make sure you've always got the correct load order selected matching the collection revision you have installed.![](https://i.postimg.cc/7LNCxzPY/image.png)
6. When prompted with ***Missing Mods in Load Order*** select ***Remove All Missing.*** This will show all of the optional mods you don't have, as well as mods from [The DIQ Archive](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/yif5lj), [DIQ Extras](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/k3zucg), [DIQ Expanded](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y0iw7z) and [DIQ Armoury](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y7cdjf) (if you're not using them) and the [Plus Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4600) dividers I use for organising the load order. \
   **Note:** [The DIQ Archive](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/yif5lj) and [Plus Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4600) are not relevant for most users.![](https://i.postimg.cc/fbsK2Ygw/image.png)\
   You will know it's worked even though the window has not closed, in the bottom left you will see the following.\
   **Note:** The number below is not the exact number you should expect, that changes over time and varies based upon what you have chosen to install.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/j21cZ9B9/image.png)
7. ***Save*** the load order.![](https://i.postimg.cc/x1zxFffP/image.png)
8. ***DiceSet\_06*** and ***Honour*** are base game files, they are not in the load order by default. You should not move them from ***Inactive Mods***. Other collection mods in the ***Inactive Mods*** are intended to be there and act as if they were ***Overrides***.\
   **UPDATE:** Since ***Patch #7*** ***DiceSet\_06*** and ***Honour*** are no longer present in [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager).\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/6qNFYsK3/image.png)
9. ***Export*** the load order to game. You must do this anytime the load order changes, collection updates etc. No such thing as too much here, click it every time you launch into the game if you wish.![](https://i.postimg.cc/HxHhyqC9/image.png)
10. When you go to ***Export*** the load order for the first time you will get the following popup. You can ignore it, and select ***Ok***. [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) has been installed through [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), but it won't complete the install until you've launched into the game at least once. After reaching the game's main menu exit the game.![](https://i.postimg.cc/N0CTwTjq/image.png)
11. Proceed to the next drop down menu: ü•π**BEFORE YOU GO! - STEP #6**.
</details>

<details><summary>ü•πBefore you go! - step #6</summary>
1. **Recommendation:** \
   Play the game on ***Custom Mode***, turn ***Honour Ruleset*** on and click ***Restore Defaults*** to toggle Tactician difficulty where applicable. Other settings here are handled via my patches and do not need changing, but you can change them if you choose.\
   \
   ***Honour Ruleset*** does not make the game super scary, it introduces [balance changes](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Guide:Undocumented_Patch_5_updates#Honour_mode) and gives bosses new [Legendary Actions](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Legendary_actions). The collection is designed with this ruleset in mind so it will provide the most consistent experience.\
   **Note:** Having a single save file is not inherent with the ***Honour Ruleset***, it's an optional setting just below it and otherwise a feature of the ***Honour Mode*** difficulty.\
   \
   *For further information on difficulty modes check out the *[*wiki page*](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Difficulty)*.*\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/hvGTCQBR/custom-difficulty-options.gif)
2. Play some BG3! Launch the game from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) or a Desktop shortcut, `bg3_dx11.exe` preferably. If you want to launch from [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) make sure to ***Enable DirectX 11 Mode***, and for further convenience enable ***Skip Launcher*** too. Keep ***Launch Through Steam*** unticked to make avoiding game updates easier.\

![](https://i.postimg.cc/B6VLCp1f/2-Updating-Guide-Collection-Game-Updates.png)‚ö†Ô∏èProceed with caution when updating in the middle of a playthrough, follow instructions.
‚ùåDO NOT UPDATE YOUR GAME PRIOR TO A MATCHING COLLECTION REVISION BECOMING AVAILABLE!

<details><summary>üí°collection updates - step by step</summary>
### Step By Step Instructions:

1. Prior to updating It is recommended that you do the following to maintain the health of an ongoing save:\
   \
   1\. Deactivate **ALL** toggle passives on your hotbars, and use the ***Remove Automation Toggles*** as shown in the GIF below.\
   2\. Respec characters to level 1 Barbarians, unless the character is already a Barbarian in which case you should select Fighter or Rogue. Respeccing all characters is generally overkill if you're keeping the collection up to date, but if you're jumping multiple revisions it's highly recommended to just do all characters.\
   **Note:** This includes companions, hirelings, Tavs and Durges, both actively in the party and at camp.\
   3\. Long rest to remove other temporary statuses and just for the sake of ruling weirdness out.\
   \
   Failure to do so can result in issues for that save moving forward, though it's likely the same process as above can just be followed retroactively if issues arise, so long as said issue isn't a save failing to load.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/FsnDMTJf/Untitled-1000-x-250-px.gif)
2. Read the [changelog](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv?tab=changelog), not just the most recent; but all changelogs from the revision you are currently on, up to the most recent.\
   \
   Follow any specific instructions found on the [changelogs](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv?tab=changelog). This may consist of things such as: Respeccing character classes, unequipping or deleting items and uninstalling a mod through [Mod Uninstaller](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701).\
   \
   [Mod Uninstaller](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701) allows you to remove mods via the [Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9162) interface, making it easier to cleanly uninstall mods that add items, passives, statuses etc.\
   \
   **Using **[**Mod Uninstaller**](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701)**:**\
   1\. Open the [Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9162) in game while loaded into the save you wish to continue playing on\
   2\. Select the [Mod Uninstaller](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701) tab and wait for data to be analyzed\
   3\. Select the mod(s) you want to uninstall, click ***uninstall***.\
   4\. Save your game and exit, the mods are now ready to be safely removed outside of the game.\
   \
   *Example of using* [*Mod Uninstaller*](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701): (The interface looks a bit different nowadays)\
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZWL1YkP.gif)
3. ***Purge*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/). Select ***Update*** on the collection through the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Collections*** tab.![](https://i.postimg.cc/WzPVHWr9/Screenshot-2024-02-02-033034.png)
4. When prompted with ***Remove mods from old revision?*** select ***Remove All***.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/nLKGDhtp/Screenshot-2024-02-02-033301.png)
5. Additionally you will be prompted to install the update into a new ***Profile***. I do not recommend this if you've customised the collection in any way, it will create more work for you. It's completely optional, and can be skipped assuming all other instructions are followed.\
   The primary benefit is the ability to swap between the ***Revision*** you've updated to, and the ***Revision*** you were on via ***Profiles***; helpful if you run into any issues, e.g.: you didn't respec a character using an updated class mod.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/Px1YTkYP/image-11.webp)
6. If you're prompted with external changes it's likely because you didn't ***Purge*** mods prior to updating, and [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) has just removed many mod files.\
   You can go ahead and save these changes, ***Deploying*** mods after the update will restore any loose files in use by the new collection revision.\
   If you get this prompt under different circumstances I'd recommend selecting ***Revert change (restore file)***. E.g.: You just verified the integrity of your game files through[ Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) without ***Purging*** mods prior.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/pLvvZ6xy/Screenshot-2024-03-08-183724.png)![](https://i.postimg.cc/hGKYzFnb/Screenshot-2024-03-08-184000.png)
7. Go through the process of downloading updates, just like initial installation.\
   .
8. Make sure to filter the mods by ***Recommended*** on the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Collection*** page and download any new versions of optional mods you were using. In certain cases when updating it will not grab the new file for an optional mod, it will just delete it. This is due to file changes in the mod and [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) not understanding that it's a new iteration of the same mod.\
   .
9. If optional mods included in the current revision which you were using have been ***Uninstalled*** or ***Disabled***, please ***Install*** or ***Enable*** them. This just happens on occasion, it's hit or miss. Read [changelogs](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv?tab=changelog) so you're aware of what has actually been removed, many optional mods are not safe to remove mid-playthrough.\
   .
10. You'll have mods grouped by ***Collection*** on your [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Mods*** page, assuming you followed installation instructions shown again just below.\
    ![](https://i.postimg.cc/rmF30Gqn/Screenshot-2024-02-29-115337.png)Remove leftover mod files from the group titled ***Unspecified***.\
    Either uninstall or disable them, preferably uninstall/delete them to save storage space and keep things organised.\
    ![](https://i.postimg.cc/FKxQ8sPS/image.png)The only exception is the collection itself, don't remove that! While you're there smash the ***Endorse*** button!\
    ![](https://i.postimg.cc/5yyybnmD/imageeeeeeeeeeeeeee.png)
11. Under the ***Version*** column you will see some mods in the collection displaying that they have additional archives (orange boxes), these can be deleted too. These are just leftovers from updating mod files.\
    Click on it to display the drop down, the version at the top is currently installed. Select the ***minus -*** icon for the version below to remove them. Toggle the little box in the bottom right to delete archives.\
    ![](https://i.postimg.cc/DzVXBF0L/Screenshot-2024-03-05-082217.png)If you're using some of the optional mods the ***Some mods are redundant warning*** will be present and not a problem, otherwise both of these warnings will go away once leftover mod files are all removed.\
    ![](https://i.postimg.cc/R0XvqQkh/Screenshot-2024-02-02-032627.png)Once you've cleaned things out properly ***Deploy*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).
12. Extract new configuration files if they've been updated.\
    If you need a refresher on the configuration files please view ***1: Installation Guide - Vortex, BG3MM & Configs***üí°->üí°***CONFIGURATION FILES - STEP #4***.
13. Export the new load order to the game through [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager).\
    If you need a refresher on the load order please view ***1: Installation Guide - Vortex, BG3MM & Configs***üí° ->üí°***BG3MM LOAD ORDER MANAGEMENT - STEP #5***.

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏ègame updates + rolling back your game version</summary>
> If you update your game before there's a matching collection revision available it's out of my scope and any issues which arise from playing the scrambled install are not my fault or responsibility. You'll either have to wait, downgrade, or attempt to maintain the updates for mods yourself which I would highly discourage.
>
> There's good reason for this, for example Patch #7/Hotfix #27 was so busted it required using a hex editor on the game's .exe files or using [Hotfix 27 Loading time fixer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13071). The load times were actually 20 minutes long with the hotfix having no upside for collection users in the slightest. The fix was found less than a week before ***Hotfix #28*** came out.

<details><summary>‚ùìStaying on Patch #6/Hotfix #25?</summary>
> Shouldn't have to be said but if you're not intending to play an old version of the game or collection no downgrading is required, you will use the latest version of [**BG3MM**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and as of ***Revision 110*** any changes to the [**Script Extender**](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) version will be overwritten by the collection and the most recent release acquired on launch.

**- REVISION 107 OF **[**Difficulty, Immersion, Quality**](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv)** IS THE LAST REVISION FOR PATCH #6/HOTFIX #25!**\
**- REVISION 26 OF **[**DIQ Extras**](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/k3zucg)** IS THE LAST REVISION FOR PATCH #6/HOTFIX #25!**\
**- REVISION 7 OF **[**DIQ Expanded**](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/y0iw7z)** IS THE LAST REVISION FOR PATCH #6/HOTFIX #25!**

- **STAY ON PATCH #6/HOTFIX #25! It's easily done through **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)** betas**\
  \- Open your [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) ***Library***, right click ***Baldur's Gate 3*** and head to ***Properties*** -> ***Betas*** -> ***Beta Participation*** and select ***release\_patch6\_hf9*** from the drop down menu.\
  \- Wait for [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) to install Hotfix #25.
- **STAY ON **[**BG3MM**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager)** Release **[**1.0.10.0**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/tag/1.0.10.0)**! NOT 1.0.11.0 +**\
  You may need to delete your `modsettings.lsx` in `%LocalAppData%\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public` if downgrading/updating [**BG3MM**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager). But realistically you should have already cleaned the install.

</details>

### Preventing the updates:

- If [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) is not open, you don't use a [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) shortcut for the game executable, and you don't have ***Launch Through Steam*** enabled in [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) will not open and no updates will be downloaded.
- If [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) is open it **HAS** to be in in ***Offline Mode*** prior to launching the game, in addition to ***Automatic Updates*** being set to ***Only update this game when I launch it*** per the setup instructions for this collection.
- ***Verifying integrity of game files*** will fetch files from the latest release, don't do it. If your install is cooked you'll have to use the [Steam Community :: Guide :: Rollback to a Previous Game Version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3023295121) guide to get previous patch/hotfix data.
- If your copy of BG3 is from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/galaxy) it's much easier to avoid updating. From the game's page in your [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy) library select ***Manage Installation*** then ***Configure...***, underneath ***Installation*** untick the box for ***Automatically update to newest version***.

### To double down on removing [Steam's](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) ability to update the game:

I'm pretty sure that [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) won't even let you launch the game while it's open so you'll be launching directly from the game's executable and will have to use ***Direct Connect*** for multiplayer.

1. Inside your `Steam\steamapps` folder find `appmanifest_1086940.acf`.
2. Right click on `appmanifest_1086940.acf` and select ***Properties*** (or press ***Alt+Enter***).
3. In the ***Properties*** window underneath ***Attributes*** tick the box for ***Read-only***.
4. Select ***Apply*** before exiting to save the changes.

***

### You can use this guide [Steam Community :: Guide :: Rollback to a Previous Game Version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3023295121) to roll back your game version through depot downloads below listed below, or those found yourself if looking for a different game version.

**NOTE:** The folder location of the download will be shown in the console window, open it in your file explorer.
Overwrite the game install with the downloaded packages, ***purge*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) prior.

- [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) will attempt to automatically update when launching the game.
- Updates are usually released when the game gets a new patch, and I do not update the collection until mods such as [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) are functional.
- What this means is that [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) updating can be a problem for your existing collection install when you're playing on a previous game version.

   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/MpqrKG3F/Screenshot-2024-09-06-132443.png)
4. When updating to ***Patch #7*** just set it to ***Latest***. This doesn't download the update itself, it just allows the ***Dwrite.dll*** installed with the collection to fetch the update on game launch.

# Ghetto Rollback:

- After launching into the game exit out and head to ***AppData > Local > BG3ScriptExtender > ScriptExtender*** put the contents of the ***19.0.0.0*** folder into the ***20.0.0.0*** folder and overwrite.
- Whenever you actually want to update [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) just delete the ***19.0.0.0*** folder, the real one will be fetched on launch.
- If another version comes out you will have to do this again, just overwrite the latest folder with the desired version of [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se).

![](https://i.postimg.cc/Y024kVKF/3-Troubleshooting-Guides.png)**Before** seeking assistance in the [Comments](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv?tab=comments) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) you should be viewing these guides.

- This is a handy external guide too: [Steam Community :: Guide :: Cleaning Cache](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018203217). If your install is old and sluggish, if you're having multiplayer connection issues, crashes/stutters etc. give it a go. Be mindful of what you're removing though things such as my configuration files may need to be put back after removal.

### Known Issues:

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èCrashes, freezes & soft locks</summary>
### During gameplay:

1. [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) *Combat Extender AI (CX AI)*.\
   AI mods have always been fickle, and it appears that Combat Extender's AI is no exception. It's working flawlessly most of the time, but in niche circumstances it can cause crashes for some users.\
   If you're experiencing a very specific crash, usually in combat, but also from destroying a specific environmental object, it could be [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207)'s Standalone AI.\
   Temporarily removing it from the ***Active*** load order by dragging it to ***Inactive*** in [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) is a tried and true temporary solution, it's perfectly fine to add/remove mid-playthrough.\
   \
   **THE FIVE? HORSEMEN OF THE CX AI CRASHPOCALYPSE:**\
   \- Nere fight (it's actually the Duergar Danna causing it)\
   \- Dror Ragzlin fight\
   \- Upstairs door of Waukeen's Rest, if broken with melee attacks\
   \- When Karlach goes angery and smashes everything after dealing with the fake Paladins of Tyr\
   \- Owlbear fight.
2. **Engine limits:**\
   There is such thing as too much, if you play with an increased party size, loads of custom auras and toggles your game is just going to be more crash prone, especially in Act III. I personally play with a party of 4 and don't have issues. If your machine/game can't handle all the craziness, try reducing it some.

### On game launch:

1. Make sure your system's anti-virus is not interfering with [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se), make an exception in your firewall(s) for BG3's .exe files if need be.
2. Don't launch the game as ***Administrator***, with the exception of the initial launch on a fresh install where it asks for elevation to install redistributable etc.

### Starting a new game:

1. There was a curious case where someone was crashing on attempting to launch a new game, it was due to their [RivaTuner Server Statistics](https://www.rivatuner.org) software running in the background and not being kept updated.\
   Make sure no 3rd party software can interfere, keep things nice and clean.
</details>

<details><summary>‚ùóÔ∏ègameplay issues</summary>
1. Increasing the party limit with [Configurable Party Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11172) causes some niche bugs, please read the mod page and educate yourself on the subject prior to adjusting the party limit above 4.
2. Using "Amulet of Lost Voices" and presumably any vanilla items which gives "Speak with Dead", will give you permanent "Recast Speak with Dead" upon after use. This is just due to how [Speak with Dead Rework and Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2144) works.
3. Items looted from containers won't be auto-sorted into bags from [Bags of Sorting - Bean's Preset with auto-sort function](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2797). If items don't get auto-sorted into containers drag the bag to another character's inventory, then back again. It should suck the items up. This is just a present limitation.
4. A few quirks with [ARSENAL OVERHAUL -- Weapon Viability Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2370). Enemies using Short Bow ability *"Rapid Fire"* single target.
5. Loading a save which is mid-combat will result in [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) health boosts not being properly applied.
6. Scrolls with spell containers (multiple different version you can cast) and reactions, such as Counterspell, may need to be added to and cast from your hotbar to function appropriately.
7. [JWL Discordant Instruments - New Equipment Slot](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9119) Few bugs showing up for this mod, below are 3 items that do not appear to be lootable. Plop the below into your SE console to acquire the items.\

   **Ansur's trinket:**

```

```
</details>

<details><summary>‚ùìCosmetic Issues</summary>
1. Since ***Patch #7*** many icons from action resources to classes and subraces have been cooked, this will be fixed over time.
2. üîû**In Game Nudity Toggles Not Working Properly:**\
   If a custom/modded item uses the chest/camp clothes slot and does not cover genitalia the game is generally assuming that it does. This circumvents the nudity being disabled. This may also be the case if a modded outfit does not have visuals for your race/gender.&#x20;
3. [Alternative Shadowheart Tattoos](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8115) on clothing which modifies the body, such as outfits from [Scantily Camp Outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2617) and some from [Basket Full of Equipment. NSFW version](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/97) the tattoo will not show up correctly on the upper arm. The same is true for any other unique bodies modified by clothing, such as Karlach, or even body tattoos from optional mod used on Tav.
4. NPCs when inspected will show as having 0m Movement Speed, they still move in combat so it's definitely just cosmetic, I have no idea why and should investigate one day.
5. [Ellian's heads](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2939) has both Eyes of the Beholder and non-EOTB version of the heads in one download. Since we're not using EOTB, those additional heads will have mesh textured eyes and should not be used.
6. Selecting ***Randomise Appearance*** in character creation will likely lead to some less than desirable outcomes. E.g. physics negatively interacting with each other, nail options being body type specific etc.
</details>

<details><summary>ü™≤vanilla bugs</summary>
1. ***Honour ruleset*** won't be saved if setting up ***Custom difficulty*** in a multiplayer lobby. Given that my recommendation is to play ***Custom difficulty*** with ***honour rules*** toggled you should do so by setting up the game solo, then getting your homie(s) to join via ***direct connect***. Double check once you're in the game that ***honour rules*** are active.
2. **"Someone in your party is not ready":**\
   Pretty sure this is a vanilla bug, but it's a nasty one. Thankfully we've got a seemingly harmless fix for it.\
   \- Trade with Withers, inside his Important Objects container locate and purchase the [Debug Book](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2119).\
   \- Use the [Debug Book](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2119) to travel to the next chronological section of the game.
3. **The Anisotropic Filtering Bug:**\
   "as of the last patch this setting doesn't seem to work anymore. Makes beards and short head hairs look blocky. A way to get around this is to force "16x Anisotropic Filtering" in Nvidia Control Panel (or AMD) 3D settings for the game, and then run the game with Direct X11 instead of Vulkan." - Stolen from the [Angels & Demons](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/bbckck) collection lol.
4. **Incorrect tooltip information**:\
   Tooltips often get stuck showing outdated information, because of this bug the information displayed may be incorrect. Save then load the game to refresh the UI if necessary.
5. [The Reviving Hands](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Reviving_Hands) Casting Revivify on a dead ally does not apply Death Ward. Casting it on an ally who is downed, but not dead yet, does apply Death Ward. (as of Patch 6)
</details>

### The Basic Troubleshoots:

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èGeneral troubleshooting: crashes, saves not loading, missing textures etc.</summary>
### Always do this first when encountering issues:

1. If it's installed remove the [LSLib/Divine Tool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) from [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), ***Uninstall*** it, don't just ***Disable*** it.
2. ***Purge*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).
3. Verify integrity of game files through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) or GOG.
4. ***Deploy*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).&#x20;
5. ***Export*** the load order to the game from BG3MM and try again.
</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èNative mod issues: Wasd character movement and/or native camera tweaks</summary>
### WASD Character Movement not working:

First make sure your issue is not simply with one of the below [WASD Character Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781) keybinds:
\- Auto-run, by default with ***Shift***+***W***.
\- Toggle between jogging and walking, by default with ***Insert***.&#x20;
\- Toggle the mod on and off with ***Caps Lock***.

1. ***Purge*** mods in Vortex.
2. Go to ***C: > SteamLibrary > steamapps > common > Baldurs Gate 3 > Bin*** and **delete** the ***NativeMods*** folder.
3. In Vortex find [WASD Character Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781), [Native Camera Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945) and [Native Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/944).
4. Right click and them and select ***Reinstall***.
5. ***Deploy*** mods in Vortex.
</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èsoft rebooting your collection install: loose file rules not set in vortex etc. </summary>
This is only really followed for resolving [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) issues. While it's a basic and may seem intuitive I wouldn't put much stock in this resolving an issue you are experiencing.

1. ***Purge*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).
2. Left click on any mod on the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Mods*** page, then press CTRL + A to select all mods.
3. You will see an options bar in the bottom left, select ***Remove***.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/7h49BfCB/Screenshot-2024-08-03-215953.png)
4. You will be greeted with a popup window with two boxes, tick the box for ***Remove Mods*** and leave it empty for ***Delete Archives***.\
   (Deleting archives means you will have to redownload the mods, we don't want that.)\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/zByYJ20m/Screenshot-2024-08-03-215800.png)
5. Remove the collection from the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) Collections page, do not tick any of the boxes for removing mods with the collection. (For the same reason as above.)
6. Restart [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/). (close and open it again.)
7. Add the collection to [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) again, from Nexus.\
   ![](https://i.postimg.cc/Ls4NNHGh/image.png)
8. Once the install has finished [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) should automatically Deploy.
9. Export the load order to the game from [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) and try again.\

<details><summary>üìåmultiplayer recommendations & troubleshooting</summary>
# Patch #7:

The new patch has made it much more difficult to get multiplayer games functioning, it can be done but there's some stupid hoops to jump through. Check out the [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) thread ***Mod issues detected + multiplayer connection*** under ‚ùó***troubleshooting***.

The ball isn't really in my court, if you don't want to be a guinea pig stay on Patch #6/Hotfix #25.

***

Hosting a multiplayer lobby is susceptible to fail, due to user error or vanilla bugs. Make sure to have 100% clean installs.

Unfortunately I have little to offer when it comes to multiplayer issues, it's not something inherently wrong with the collection. Everyone who fixes it does so by following my existing troubleshooting guides, removing temp files etc. When in doubt others resolve it with a full nuke of **everything** BG3.

- To play multiplayer with any modded setup you must have all the exact same mods, load order, configuration files, everything! (For most things anyway.)
- [Steam Community :: Guide :: Cleaning Cache](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018203217) removing temp files and having a properly cleaned install prior to setting up the collection goes a long way with avoiding problems.
- You may need to be logged into a Larian account through the launcher, though you should be setup to skip the launcher anyway.\
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/50gBw8fw/image-7.webp)
- In your ***Baldurs Gate 3 > Data*** folder delete **all folders** (not **.pak** files) titled ***Mods***, ***SharedDev*** or ***GustavDev***.
- Make sure you're not attempting to start a multiplayer lobby in the middle of camp events and what not, sometimes you'll need to finish something up in single player before it'll let friends join.&#x20;
</details>

<details><summary>‚ùìtemporarily reverting your game to vanilla</summary>
**I want to return to a vanilla playthrough without deleting the collection, is it possible?**\
You can easily return the game to a vanilla state temporarily by ***purging*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), or swapping to another empty ***profile*** in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/). Then ***exporting*** an empty load order with [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), or, you can just delete the `modsettings.lsx` inside `C: > (User) > Appdata > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3 > PlayerProfiles > Public > Savegames > Story`.

To reactivate your collection install just ***deploy*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), or swap to the DIQ [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***profile***. and ***export*** the appropriate load order with [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager).

This is not the same as a clean install, and just for temporarily swapping to vanilla. For reverting your game install to a vanilla state, please see further troubleshooting below.
</details>

### Less Frequent:

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èblack armour textures</summary>
[Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1827) *Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures - TEXTURES* and *Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures - VTEX to TEX* are the relevant mod files here, this is an optional mod.

1. ![](https://i.postimg.cc/cJs6kQ1N/upscale.png)Make sure that both files are installed for [Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1827).
2. If they are and you're experiencing the issue, ***right click*** and select ***reinstall*** on the ***Textures*** file, then ***deploy*** mods.&#x20;
</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏ècan't level up: crashes, "choices pending" etc.</summary>
This is generally caused from updating mods and not ***Respeccing*** as is recommended.\
**Note:** If you're an ***Oathbreaker Paladin***, or using a custom class with the ***Oathbreaker*** tag you can use the [Appearance Edit Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/899) ***Respec*** option to skip regaining your oath.

### Level up issues:

1. If you can't level up due to crashes or "*choices pending*" try ***Respeccing*** your character.
2. If this does not work ***Respec*** all characters to level 1 Barbarian, Fighter, or Rogue.&#x20;
3. If this also fails follow the ‚ö°Ô∏è***General troubleshooting***.
</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èdebug profiles/modsettings.lsx reset on launch: mods and save files not present in game</summary>
This is less common nowadays, for a time [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) would conflict with the [Native Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/944) and cause this.
What will almost certainly cause this is having ANY [Achievement Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/668) files installed, including the log files.

1. Check your ***Appdata > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3 > Player Profiles*** for ***Debug*** profiles and delete them
2. Check in ***Task Manager*** for additional instances of the game attempting to run and close them all.
3. Refresh [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) and check the ***Profile*** drop down menu, it should just show ***Public***.
4. Then restart your PC.

If you have added external mods to your collection install, and your ***modsettings.lsx*** (load order) is being reset upon launching the game you've likely introduced a bad egg. One of the mods need removing, go through a process of elimination, It will happen even if the mod is Inactive in [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), it just has to be present in the ***Appdata > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3 > Mods*** folder for the issue to occur.
</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èvortex: corrupt load order warning</summary>
### [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/): Corrupt Load Order Warning

1. Remove the [LSLib/Divine Tool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) from [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), ***Uninstall*** it, don't just ***Disable*** it.
2. ***Purge*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).
3. CTRL + A on the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Mods*** page to select all mods.
4. You will see an options bar in the bottom left, ***Uninstall*** all mods but do not remove the ***Archives***. (Doing so means you will have to redownload the collection, we don't want that.)
5. Remove the collection from the [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) ***Collections*** page, do not tick any of the boxes for removing mods with the collection. (For the same reason as above.)
6. Restart [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).
7. Add the collection to [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) again, from Nexus.

If the above does not work you can try making a fresh ***Profile*** in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) (You will have to enable ***Profile Management*** in the ***Settings***.) It should however be fixed, and should never have been an issue to begin with by following the installation instructions.
</details>

### ‚ö°Ô∏èCleaning out your BG3 folders:

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èvortex failing to manage files: remnant files in game folders</summary>
Alternatively follow [How to Remove All Mods from BG3](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/How-to-remove-mods).

I've only experienced files being unmanaged by [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) once, it was when I swapped ***Deployment Methods*** without ***Purging*** mods in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), I don't think that bug exists anymore either.

Delete all `.symlink` files if that was the deployment method in use.
File paths shown below are based on a default [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) install.

1. ***Purge*** mods in Vortex.
2. Go to your `C: > Users > USER > AppData > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3 > Mods` folder and delete the:\
   ***Everything, make it an empty folder.***
3. Go to your `C: > Users > USER > AppData > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3 > PlayerProfiles > Public` folder and delete the:\
   `modsettings.lsx`\
   Any `Debug Profile` folders you see
4. Go to `C: > SteamLibrary > steamapps > common > Baldurs Gate 3 > Bin` and **delete** the:\
   `NativeMods` folder\
   `SDL2.dll`\
   `Dwrite.dll`\
   `bind2w64.dll`\
   `bink2w64_original.dll` (this you would rename to `bind2w64.dll` for returning to vanilla, we're just nuking all [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) managed files. Also, if it's a `.symlink` this would not be any good.)\
   `ScriptExtenderSettings.json` \
   `ScriptExtenderUpdaterConfig.json` \
   You might as well delete ***every*** `log` file too, and make sure there's no remnants from previously using ***Achievement Enabler*** if you ever had it installed.
5. Go to `C: > SteamLibrary > steamapps > common > Baldurs Gate 3 > Data`\*\*\* ***folder and delete the***:\*\*\*\
   `Cursors` folder\
   `Generated` folder\
   `Mods` folder\
   `Public` folder
6. In [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) go to ***Library > Baldurs Gate III > Properties > Installed files*** and select ***Verify integrity of game files***. Let the scan and potential download finish.
7. ***Deploy*** mods in Vortex, check that they're deployed properly.\
   e.g. No folders, only `.pak` files in the `appdata` `Mods` folder from step ***3***. (A few exceptions such as `readme` files)
8. Test ***Purging*** mods. If the game's folders appear as they did after step ***7*** you're all good to go.\
   If you've followed this whole guide you'll need to follow installation steps again, such as ***manually installing*** my configuration files and launching into the game at least once with mods ***Deployed*** so [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) installs properly.

**NOTE:** If you've installed other collections previously, or just done a [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) only install there may be modded `.pak` files in your `C: > SteamLibrary > steamapps > common > Baldurs Gate 3 > Data` folder. Below is a screenshot of the vanilla files which you should **NOT** delete as of Hotfix #22, 21st of March, 2024.\
**NOTE:** The image is cut off, there are 19 `VirtualTextures_X.pak` files.\

- ***BG3 BG3SE*** - Only used by [Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2172). (deploys to the ***bin*** folder.)
- ***Engine Injector*** - Used by mods such as [WASD Character Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781), [Native Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/944), [Native Camera Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945), and [Baldur's Priority - CPU Performance FPS Optimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1326). (deploys to the ***bin*** folder. Mods require a ***bin*** folder in their file structure for correct deployment.)
- ***BG3 Loose*** - Used by many mods, mostly just texture/mesh replacers. (deploys to the ***data*** folder.)
- ***BG3 Replacer*** - Not currently used in the collection, would be used for setting up override mods for a Vortex only install. (deploys to the ***data*** folder.)
- ***BG3 LSLib*** - Only used by the [LSLib/Divine Tool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib), which is not being used in this collection. (doesn't deploy to anywhere.)

### DIQ's unique custom item delivery system:

- You can purchase custom items from **Withers** through the power of [Trade with Withers](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2458) and all the patches I've created! The items range from weapons and crafting tools, to clothes and dyes. Prices have been reduced and stats nerfed as needed.\
  \
  It's mostly cosmetic stuff, and is an alternative delivery method which I've opted to use instead of [Tutorial Chest Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457) or [AV Item Shipment Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8295). The reason for this is to make the items un-exploitable for gold, further curated/organised and keeps other vendor's selections closer to how they were in vanilla.\
  \
  All other items are distributed through the game world for immersive and balanced acquisition.\
  [Yield to Temptation - Tutorial Chest Anti-Cheat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4913) makes sure the beginning of your journey isn't like Dragon Age: Origins giving you a bunch of random DLC items, but even more overpowered and numerous.\

  **Note:** [Tutorial Chest Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457) is still included as an optional mod, but it only exists for my testing purposes and for filthy cheaters to use.\

### Below are some of the more notable items you can purchase from Withers:

- Anvils for [JWL Crafting Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1624) which are utilised to upgrade weapon rarity through [JWL Soul Smithing - Upgrade Your Gear](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1626) which is compatible with [Vanilla Equipment Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5312).\
  **Note:** If a unique item which should be upgradeable isn't, let me know and/or cross reference the lists provided on the above mod pages.
- The early game firearms from [Artificer class and all subclasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1779).
- The early game scrolls from [Valkrana's Spellbook - 12 New Necromancy Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1258).

  **Note:** Increasing the party limit beyond 4 has its own set of bugs, educate yourself on the subject by reading the mod's page.
- [Vanilla Equipment Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5312) adds passives to some weapons which disallow the weapon from being disarmed if the creature wielding it meets a criteria. Notably this means you cannot disarm Commander Zhalk of his flaming sword in the tutorial, or Voss of his Astral Silver Sword.
- [Animate Dead Plus Plus - Necromancy Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/642) and [Automated Summons](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10922) will add some toggleable passives to your main character whenever you first Short Rest or toggle Non-Lethal Attacks.\
  This GIF shows the two automation toggles for summons and the button to remove all these passives from your character, which is only really useful for updating or removing the mods.\

<details><summary>ü§†character creation</summary>
- Some Origin characters have messed up colours of the character creation screen. This is a side effect of them being customisable, however it's **ONLY** on the character creation screen. They will not look like this as NPC party members.\
  Having [Appearance Edit Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/899) as an optional file is a headache for compatibility, as some mods need to be patched to work alongside it such as [Origin's Gods](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6305), so it's included in the main list. It does not take very long at all to select the appropriate eye, hair and skin colours, and to stick a beard back on to Gale. If you're not playing as one of these 4 Origin characters, or weren't going to use their default appearances, then this is entirely irrelevant to you.\
  **WARNING:** Wyll is a special case when it comes to Origin character editing, if he undergoes a certain transformation in Act I it will likely remove customisations made to him. He will not be further editable without resetting his appearance to his human form, which can be done via [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se). My advice is to just not bother editing Wyll.\
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/CKGsmgsf/origin-characters-at-home.png)
- Selecting ***Randomise Appearance*** in character creation will likely lead to some less than desirable outcomes. For example, slots such as the Dragonborn Jaw, or Horns can be used for layering hairstyles if you wish (layering hairstyles etc. may cause physics to negatively interact with each other). There's a great number of options, and you're best to build your character piece by piece. \
  Unless you're looking for some inspiration, like I have below.\

- At the bottom of the Tattoo Style section Githyanki characters can select different spots to those on their head preset. Keep in mind that this does not alter the texture of the head, ridges and bumps will still be present but match the colour of your skin.\
  **NOTE:** This is not really functional for races other than Githyanki, and when using this function you must choose your spots prior to selecting a tattoo, selecting Githyanki spots again will remove your tattoo selection.\
  ![](https://i.postimg.cc/8cKTD1rf/Screenshot-2024-11-28-123549.png)
- All classes can now choose deities! If you wish to opt out of deity selection, choose ***Faithful*** or ***Faithless***, these are the only options without dialogue tags associated.\
  **Note:**\
  \- [Silvanus](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6591) does not have new dialogue associated, uses dialogue options shared amongst deities.\

1. Seeing loot in the loot preview window which is unattainable? Read the pinned post for [Enhanced World Tooltips](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2037).\
   "After a bit of research, I decided to leave the preview in this state. This way you at least know that there is something unobtainable still in the inventory. And, there is a known trick that lets you get such items. See: [How to get unobtainable items from corpses](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15vt61g/tips_tricks_how_to_get_unlootable_items_off/)." - [Proxa](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/4227774).
2. Find a looted corpse that doesn't show "empty" beside its name when you hold Alt. This indicates it has something equipped that you weren't able to loot.
3. Pick up the body
4. Click through a character's equipment slots and on one of them the item will show up as an **Equipped** item that, when moused over, shows it's equipped by the corpse. Do NOT click it yet.
5. Unequip whatever item you have in that slot so that it doesn't automatically swap to the body (if you did this accidentally you can still get the item back using this method).
6. Click on the empty slot and select the corpse's object to have it jump in to the slot - or your bags if you are unable to equip it for some reason.\

> Below is not a factor until the mod is updated with icons representing stack counts, it's been removed. Thanks Patch #7!

- [Universal Max Stack](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4359) is a great mod for keeping a cleaner inventory, allowing you to stack items which do not stack in vanilla. Though it's got a pretty big quirk, if you have a stacked equippable item you can equip the whole stack (with no gameplay/stat benefit). **You don't want to do that, it can allegedly cause issues**, split the stack and equip just one.\
  Slightly tedious, but the pros outweigh the cons, most items you'll want to equip over the course of the game are unique and therefore won't stack. This is a little more annoying in the very early game, but it is what it is for now.\

> Auto-hide is now a toggleable feature on all these mods post-Patch #7.

- **Auto-Hide UI Elements:** If you don't like the contextual UI, these can be swapped out for different versions in Vortex. ***uninstall*** or ***disable*** them through [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), not [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) or manually.\
  On the ***collections*** page in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), you can set the included versions to ***Ignore*** so they won't be downloaded during collection updates. If you ***uninstalled*** them, then not doing this will result in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) warning you that there's ***missing dependencies***, if you only ***disabled*** them it will not.\
  The different download options have the same ***UUID***, so you'll be notified of mod conflicts in both [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) and [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) if you don't remove the versions included in this collection.\

<details><summary>ü§¨difficulty: to customise or overcome?</summary>
### Customising the difficulty through Combat Extender:

[Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) is the primary mod controlling the increased difficulty in this collection, for some users my [configuration file](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9784) for [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) is too much.&#x20;

- I encourage everyone to customise this config to their liking, I highly recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as it will let you know if you've made errors, or at least [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) instead of [Notepad](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9msmlrh6lzf3?hl=en-US\&gl=US).
- [Configuration Explained](https://github.com/Zehtukae/combat-extender/blob/main/Source/ConfigurationExplained.json#L281) is an overview of how the config works.
- If your [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se) console is filling up with red texts usually referring to boosts not being applied then you've made errors.
- You can make edits to your ***CombatExtender.json*** in ***C: > (User) > Appdata > Local > Larian Studios > Baldur's Gate 3 > Script Extender*** while the game is running, and load a save to apply changes. Great for testing!
- While you can just remove the mod (***Disable*** in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), redo [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) steps) you will be missing out on some interesting gameplay changes, such as enemies using many more spells and abilities, keeping combat fresh and interesting.
- **Note:** [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) uses Tactician difficulty stats as a base, decreasing the difficulty from Tactician has no impact on the buffs provided to enemies through [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207)'s configuration file.
- Just bellow is the related lined for health, the *"StaticBoost": 0.69* means all NPCs of that type have their health increased by 69%. Given that the Tactician difficulty (used as a baseline) increases it by 30%, the collection essentially doubles the health of all NPCs.

```
  "Health": {
    "Allies": {
	    "HealthMultiplier": 0,
      "StaticBoost": 0.69,
      "HealthPerLevel": 0.005
	},
    "Bosses": {
      "HealthMultiplier": 0,
      "StaticBoost": 0.69,
      "HealthPerLevel": 0.010
    },
    "Enemies": {
      "HealthMultiplier": 0,
      "StaticBoost": 0.69,
      "HealthPerLevel": 0.005
```

### Overcoming the challenges:

As soon as you escape the tutorial and it's just you and Shadowheart many players encounter a situation, the Intellect Devourers at the crash site appear too powerful. You can skip this fight and return to it later, the easiest means of doing so is to scale the cliff face to the north-east, otherwise, use stealth and line of sight to defeat them.

Below is some general advice for dealing with the increased difficulty.

- Use crowd control spells such as Command, Hold Person and Sleep, instead of focusing on strictly doing damage.
- Use Bless and other buff spells. Casters using Concentration spells should have Constitution Proficiency to succeed Saving Throws more often, you can get this from numerous sources, such as gear.
- Don't sleep on consumable items.
- Focus on positioning, positioning can be everything.
- Think about synergistic builds, and pay attention to [Damage Combos](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5368). I recommend 2 physical damage dealers and 2 casters for the average player, with your casters primarily providing utility, while you physical classes get to killing. (This is especially ideal in the early game, as casters begin to really come online with level 2 and 3 spells.)\

<details><summary>ü•±BRand new exhaustion system! it's not as tedious as it sounds!</summary>
The new exhaustion system from [Exhaustion. Resources regen. Final version with add-ons](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2986) (reuploaded here for ***Patch #7*** [Custom Exhaustion with Addons Patch 7.](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12165)) is inspired by what is found in 5E D\&D, however the version being used here is much less debilitating, and a more gradual stacking debuff. Exhaustion is a system only for player characters, and not NPCS.

It is a highly customisable mod, and the way I've decided to use it here is to not hinder the overall experience, by having you slog around, walking into new encounters head to toe in debuffs.&#x20;

- There are SEVEN levels of Exhaustion, each worse than the last.
- Short Rest AND Long Rest remove ALL levels of Exhaustion.
- To receive a level of Exhaustion the character must fail a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw.

It is set up this way to help flavour individual fights, by making them more dynamic.

### Exhaustion is acquired in the following ways:

- Being hit with a Critical Hit.
- Attacking with a Critical Miss.
- Being Incapacitated, e.g.: Frozen, Stunned, Paralyzed, Haste Lethargy.
- Some status effects e.g.: Burning, Shocked, Chilled, Rage & Frenzy (after removing).
- Getting knocked down e.g.: Prone, Unconscious.
- Getting knocked out (reduced to 0 HP); including Survival instinct, Death ward, Relentless Endurance & Relentless Rage.

### The levels of Exhaustion are as follows:

1. Movement Cost increased 10%. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 1.
2. Movement Cost increased 20%. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 2.
3. Movement Cost increased 30%. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 3. Disadvantage on Stealth, Survival and Perception Skill Check rolls.
4. Movement Cost increased 50%. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 4. Disadvantage on Stealth, Survival, Perception and Sleight of Hand Skill Check rolls.
5. Movement Cost increased 70%. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 5. Disadvantage on Stealth, Survival, Perception, Sleight of Hand and Investigation Skill Check rolls.
6. Movement Cost increased 90%. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 6. Disadvantage on Stealth, Survival, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Investigation, Athletics and Acrobatics Skill Check rolls. Cannot take Reactions.
7. Movement Cost doubled. All Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, Savings Throws and Armour Class is reduced by 7. Disadvantage on all Skill Check rolls. Cannot take Reactions. Disadvantage on Attack Rolls.

### Supplemental Information:

<details><summary>2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£level 20 support?</summary>
### Looking for an increased level cap?

[UnlockLevelCurve - Level 13-20 I PATCH 6](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/377) has been a popular choice for some time but never included in this collection. Nowadays [Expansion (with Bladesinger) Level 13-20 (Configurable)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/279) is a much better choice. I've never had much interest in going beyond level 12, and until [Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/279)'s recent updates the custom level 13-20 progressions for vanilla classes were very incomplete in [UnlockLevelCurve](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/377).

- For now, such modifications you would do yourself by editing the `Expansion.json` configuration file found in `AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Script Extender\Expansion`.
- While this is a simple to edit I'd recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or at least [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) instead of [Notepad](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9msmlrh6lzf3?hl=en-US\&gl=US).
- Not all custom classes and subclasses have progressions beyond level 12, they should all have a dummy level for level 13 though. The point of dummy levels is to make it so the game does not crash when you level a class/subclass to level 12, as the game will automatically initiate the level up screen for level 13 at which point you will multiclass.
- You will likely want to adjust to XP curve but it's rather subjective customisation so I'll leave you to it. Below is the only thing that really matters if you want to level past level 12 and not have wasted XP come Act III.

Change this:

```
¬† ¬† },
¬† ¬† "Max Level":{
¬† ¬† ¬† "Level": 12

<details><summary>üßålack of custom race mods?</summary>
I currently have a few reasons for not being interested in custom races.

### **A lack of all in one patches for mods adding CC options:**

Many mods have proprietary patches for X, Y, Z race mods. This is a problem when it comes to bloat, more pak files means longer loading times, and having potentially dozens of individual pak files so a single custom race can have more options doesn't feel like good bang for my buck. Many authors are against AIO patching and only offer individual patches, so I'm unsure if this is a resolvable problem.

### **Unbalanced and overpowered racial stats:**

This speaks for itself really, vanilla races are reasonably well balanced, many custom races are not.

### **A lack of custom tags and dialogue:**

Walking around as an Angel, Bugbear or Goblin might be cool, but it's made a lot less cool when the world doesn't react to you as such.

### **Bugs:**

Some race mods have issues, most seem just fine but I've had quite a few users of DIQ come into the [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) with problems caused by a custom races they added. If you're intent on adding them make sure to read all available information, make sure it's not long since abandoned.

### **The inability to remove the mods:**

Over the course of curating DIQ I have never had a save with issues I could not fix for someone (unless they had a bugged out honour save with no backups don't do that). Throughout my updates I always keep in mind users with ongoing playthroughs, were a custom race to be a pain point and need removing it would be a bit of a predicament. Custom items can now be rather easily removed through Mod Uninstaller. Class mods are usually not a problem at all to remove, it's just not the same if a custom race is in use. Resculpt could be used through Appearance Edit Enhanced, but that's a last resort. I don't really trust that feature, even though some of its most glaring issues only appear to come up when it's used on Origin characters.

# INSTALLING THE CATEGORY DIVIDERS FOR [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager)

**Note:** You needn't do this at all unless you're wanting the advantages it can provide when customising large load orders. It will, even if not significantly, increase load times; these are mod files after all.
Doing it the way demonstrated below allows you to easily disable/enable dividers as you see fit, but it's not exactly the best way of going about it. Alternatively just put all the ***.pak*** files in the same ***.zip*** folder and import that.

1. First you'll want to manually download the all in one file for [Plus Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4600).
2. Most of the downloads on that page aren't an appropriate file structure for [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), ***.zip*** files inside of ***.zip*** files.
3. With the all in one download for example you have to unzip 2 layers of files to just have the ***.zip*** files with ***.pak*** files inside, then import those into [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).![](https://i.postimg.cc/MKzyVz4L/wergwegwefwvsdvvserve.png)
4. You can make a local ***collection*** in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) and add all of those ***.zip*** files only containing ***.pak*** files. This will help keep things organised, and this abundance of mod files tucked away.
5. Refresh [BG3MM](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), grab a fresh load order ***.json*** file if needed, you will no longer be prompted to remove the missing category dummy files.

  There are 4 files for this mod, 3 are addons (below) which require the main file (above).\
  View the mod page for information on the buffs.\
  \- *addon Advantage*\
  \- *addon Immunities*\
  \- *addon Legendary Resistance charges*.\
  **NOTE:** Difficulty needs to be dropped down and put back up to Tactician if adding or removing mid-playthrough.
- [Injuries](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12911) My most ambitious mod yet but still in early stages, check out the page.

### BUG FIX:

- [JWL Fix for Cerys and Zevlor with Minthara in Act 2-3](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8237) Add this as needed. Bandage fix for the bug of Cerys/Zevlor always joining encounter turn order after recruiting Minthara. Safe to add/remove any time. Read the description!

### Party Size and Management:

- [Sit This One Out 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6183) Lets you pick which party members participate in combat, recommend only if you're taking more than 4 companions with you via [Configurable Party Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11172). Each character will be given a toggleable passive and a spell, I recommend just using the toggle, it's a bit easier.

<details><summary>üê±quality of lifE: Cheating, convenience, performance, time savers</summary>
### Goated:

- [Smart Autosaving](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5899) Smart Autosaving is a mod designed to autosave regularly while minimizing gameplay interruption. **Condition-based autosaving**: The mod autosaves at regular intervals (10 minutes by default), but it also checks various in-game states, like whether the player is in dialogue, trading, combat, lockpicking, etc. Based on these checks, it decides whether to trigger an autosave.\
  **Autosave postponement**: If a save is due (based on the timer) but the player is in a restricted state (like dialogue), instead of skipping the autosave entirely, the mod waits until the player leaves that state before autosaving.\
  **Save and load-aware**: The mod will reset the timer if any other save is created, be it manual or otherwise, or when loading saves, so as to not create saves unnecessarily. You set it to save every 15 minutes but you saved at minute 14? It will now autosave only after minute 29.
- [Less Crowd Characters](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9746) *None*. Can help performance.

### For people on their 500th playthrough:

- [OIO - Overexplained Interaction Options - DCs Approvals and Flags in Dialogues](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2631) Subjective, definitely not for the blind playthrough enjoyers, but the more you play the game the more enjoyable a mod like this is.
- [Customizable Auto Loot Aura - Item Pickup AoE for Obsessive Hoarders](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2342) Get the best looting experience this side of Cormyr. Highly recommend reading this mod page, it has a lot of features. Do not leave the auto looting on permanently, toggle it on/off using it intentionally to speed up looting areas dense with items. Safe to remove mid-playthrough by following uninstall instructions.
- [Customizable Auto Loot Aura - Item Pickup AoE for Obsessive Hoarders](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2342) *"AoE Reduced 5"*. For those who may think 18m is too large of a radius for vacuum looting. Safe to add/remove mid-playthrough.

### "Cheating" that doesn't really matter in this game:

- [Carry Weight Increased - Up To Over 9000](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/522) *x900*. If you're not using this the collection defaults to x5 increase, high Strength characters have about 1k capacity.

### Cheating:

- [Tutorial Chest Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457) *Tutorial Chest Summoning - No Hide*. Summon a phantom tutorial chest to take free stuff if you're a filthy cheater. Cosmetics can be purchased from Withers, and items can be deleted through [Mod Uninstaller](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701), you don't need this mod anymore. Safe to remove mid-playthrough by using the uninstaller download.

### Performance:

These two mods have been correlated with some crashing on game launch on Patch #7.

- [Baldur's Priority - CPU Performance FPS Optimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1326) Elevates the CPU priority of the game process to High. Helps with performance especially when multitasking. e.g. running a web browser on another monitor.\
  Safe to add/remove mid-playthrough.

### **Other:**

- [NPC Scanner for Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11726) This can be used to gather Guids and Handles of NPCs for further customising the [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) config through overrides or the cloning feature.
</details>

<details><summary>üíÖüèºCustomisation: Transmog, body tattoos, makeup, unique tav stuff</summary>
### Character Customisation Tools:

- [Transmog Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2922) Provides 2 unique items to your player character on game load, *Transmog Appearance* and *Reset Appearance* allowing you to convert the appearance of almost any item you can equip on another, including custom items. Save/Reload once you're done changing the appearance of items. Read mod page for more information, can have its quirks.
- [Transmog Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2922) *TE Hide Appearance Ring*. Adds an additional item to help with transmogging, this one allowing you to make any item's model invisible.
- [Hide Cloaks (Invisible cloaks)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1642) If you don't really like how cloaks look this will make the models for all the vanilla cloaks invisible. Alternatively, you can use the *"Hide Appearance Ring"* from [Transmog Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2922) to just hide the specific cloaks you do not like.

### Tattoo Tool:

- [Magic Mirror Menu (MMM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7258) Formerly *Body Tattoo Switcher*.\
  Avoid using this GUI for anything more than body tattoos.\
  You cannot access the GUI inside of initial character creation, instead you will customise your body tattoos once in the game.\
  It can be used on companion NPCs to give them tattoos from the default tattoo files, but is meant to be used with compatible Unique Tav body tattoo mods.

### Body Tattoos:

These are mutually exclusive, meaning, you should only install one. Installing all of them means the last in this list wins and cause benign "*Some mods are redundant*" warnings in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).\
![](https://i.postimg.cc/SQdzByrQ/Screenshot-2024-07-28-105158.png)These only overwrite the body tattoo atlas for Tav, no NPC ink is affected!

- [Magic Mirror Menu (MMM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7258) *Default Body Tattoo Atlas*. This is a vanilla tattoo atlas for use with [Unique Tav Custom Appearance](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754), it is useful for people playing as Gith to reapply their body spots with tattoo option 2 or 3.
- [Body Switcher Tattoo's](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7323)&#x20;
- [Lawful or Chaotic - Sleeve Back and Chest Body Tattoos](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5425)&#x20;

These are mutually exclusive, meaning, you should only install one. Installing all of them means the last in this list wins.
These overwrite the vanilla makeup options for Tav only!

- [Myky's Makeup and Tattoos](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11280) *Myky's Makeup and Tattoos - Unique Tav*.\
  Tattoo and makeup options both included in this pack.
- [Tattoo collection by Mari](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6235)&#x20;

### Makeup:

These are mutually exclusive, meaning, you should only install one. Installing all of them means the last in this list wins.
These overwrite the vanilla makeup options for Tav only!

- [Myky's Makeup and Tattoos](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11280) *Myky's Makeup and Tattoos - Unique Tav*.\
  Tattoo and makeup options both included in this pack.
- [Myky's Makeup and Tattoos](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11280) *Myky's Makeup (Stubble) - Unique Tav*.\
  If you want some beards instead of blush.
- [Mari's makeup](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4201)&#x20;

**Exception to the rule:**

- [Lemons Makeup \_DragonBorn UTAV Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12980) Just overwrites the Dragonborn atlas.
</details>

<details><summary>üì∑Graphics: trees, rocks, dirt, water, hair, armour</summary>
**Note:** The following optional texture mods will demand more VRAM and could negatively impact performance.

### Visuals:

- [BG3 Texture Upscale Project (BG3TUP)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12402) Biggest download in the collection!
- [Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1827) *Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures - TEXTURES* & *Upscaled Armour and Clothes Textures - VTEX to TEX*.\
  Looks really nice, not recommended if you are short on VRAM or storage space. This mod is a good chunk of the overall collection size. YOU NEED TO INSTALL BOTH OR NEITHER!
- [HD Hair and Beards v1.1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3496) Recommended to be used with TAA (anti-aliasing, in video options), looks great with DLAA for me too. Can make some hairstyles look too thin, may not be preferred by all.
- [Vivid Landscapes - Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7421) *4k* & *4k Rough Sea*. Overwrites the included lower resolution options of the main list.&#x20;
- [Vivid Landscapes - Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6844) *4k*. Overwrites the included lower resolution options of the main list.

- [Vivid Landscapes - HD Ground and Terrain Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6473) *2k*. Overwrites the included lower resolution options of the main list.\
  The above 3 mods will cause "*Some mods are redundant*" warnings in [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), but they can be safely ignored.\

***

![](https://i.postimg.cc/mkmqyhNp/5-Featured-Mods-By-Category.png)Every (non-optional) mod in the collection is listed in drop down menus here, the only exception is when I'm delayed in adding all of the changes; which can be found in the [Changelog](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv?tab=changelog). I recommend that you at least skim through this.
It's only kind of a mess, I keep coming back to clean it up here and there.

## Increased Difficulty

Yep, it's in the name.

<details><summary>üôàCombat/difficulty changes!</summary>
### Primary:

- [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) Controls stats and spells/abilities for NPCs, highly customisable. Get my customised configs! Safe to add/remove mid-playthrough.\
  **Note:** This is a large backbone of what gives DIQ a fresh combat experience, it's not just difficulty.
- [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207) *Combat Extender AI (CX AI)*. AI mod, making enemies a bit less silly, a bit more lethal. Perfectly fine to add/remove mid-playthrough.
- [Exhaustion. Resources regen. Final version with add-ons](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2986) reuploaded here for ***Patch #7*** [Custom Exhaustion with Addons Patch 7.](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12165)\

  \- Remove\_All\_Levels\_Of\_Exhaustion\_On\_Long\_Rest\
  \- Remove\_One\_Level\_Of\_Exhaustion\_On\_Short\_Rest

### New Encounters:

- [Many More Monsters](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11639)&#x20;
- [Valkrana's Undead Encounters - New Bosses Fights Items and Allies](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9024)&#x20;

### Modified Encounters:

- [Beholder Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3811) Makes the Spectator un-petrify all of the Drow in the Underdark. Spicy!
- [Orin's True Bossfight](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4107) Once the \*redacted\* has been defeated you will fight Orin's \*redacted\*.

### Difficulty through immersive restrictions:

- [Scroll Casting Revised](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10027) \*If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. \*\
  Has [MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9162) support, by default with collection configuration files all casting out of combat will succeed.
- [Heavy Armor Impedes Movement (RAW)](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10540) Wearing Heavy Armor with low Str. (lower than 13 or 15 depending on armor type) will reduce your movement speed by 3m. As it is in 5e rules.
- [Mobility Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2376) Characters must succeed Acrobatics checks on jumps and falls or become Unbalanced, when taking fall damage do an additional check to prevent getting knocked down, Rogues and Monks receive some improvements to their mobility abilities. \
  **Note:** Movement speed penalties from heavy armour are not present in the collection due to not using [Equipment Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2398).

### Other combat changes:

- [Automated Summons](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10922) *SE*. Let the stupid ass AI take control of your army of assorted animals! If you want of course.
- [Critical Miss Has Consequences](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1883) For the enemies too! Whenever a character is attacked with a Critical Miss they can take a free Attack of Opportunity against the attacker. Includes some support for ranged Attacks of Opportunity.
- [BlocknMiss Differentiation](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9646) IMMERSION! Sometimes you block instead of the enemy missing, custom animation too!
- [Initiative Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1247) *D6* for *MCM - A*. Configured to be a d6 instead of the vanilla d4.\
  **Note:** Player accessible initiative bonuses have been nerfed some, initiative in DIQ hits a sweet spot between the randomness of tabletop and predictability of the base game.
- [Sensible Ambushing - Stealth Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13114) This is a WIP mod which is disabled by default through my configs, feel free to take part in the testing and give feedback in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) thread for it!

## Quality of Life

The simple things, and sometimes not so simple things, which make a big difference.

<details><summary>üê±quality of life changes!</summary>
### Camera and movement:

- [Remove Camera Move](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5046) No longer will you attack the ground due to unneeded camera movement!
- [Native Camera Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945) No longer will you be so heavily restricted by the camera! Very configurable!
- [WASD movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781) Swap between point and click movement and WASD directional movement at will!
- [Configurable movement speed - MCM compatible](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2861) You can zoom zoom. Please be careful how much you zoom zoom. I recommend pairing this with [Teleport Party To You Spell](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2149) for if you get stuck under stairs or something, by default with my configs it's disabled.
- [Teleport Party To You Spell](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2149) Get a little bit of that DOS II convenience back, pathing for your companions can be a pain. A spell is added to all controlled characters which will summon companions and summons to your location. Not usable in combat. Safe to remove mid-playthrough by using the uninstaller download.

### Immersive + convenience mods:

- [More Reactive Companions](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5447) This mod makes it so your companions potentially speak up in place of Tav for observations of the environment etc.
- [Use Highest Modifier in dialogue - *"Use Highest Modifier Mod."*](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2171) Your Barbarian with negative Intelligence is trying to understand some magical shit? And Gale is just standing there again, isn't he? Well now your companions can actually assist you in these dialogue checks!
- [Use Best Sleight of Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5036) Same as above but for lockpicking and pickpocketing.&#x20;
- [Reduce NPC Banter Repetitiveness](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7034) Quit the repetitive yapping.
- [JWL Drop All The Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1475) *Drop ALL the loot*. Vendors drop all of their loot upon death. Unbalanced? Maybe. Immersive? Convenient? Yes.

- [Approval Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/644)&#x20;

- [Minthara Moves - Halsin and Minthara tents separated](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14148)&#x20;

### Big convenience mods:

- [Configurable Party Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11172) By default the party limit is still 4, edit the limit through the [MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9162) in-game.\
  **Note:** Increasing the party limit beyond 4 has its own set of bugs, educate yourself on the subject by reading the mod's page.
- [Lodestones](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7417?_gl=1*nuwheh*_ga*MTUzMDczNjAzMi4xNzA0NzM1OTI2*_ga_N0TELNQ37M*MTcwOTYxNzk2MC40NjcuMS4xNzA5NjMwMTQ2LjAuMC4w) Summon and dismiss any companion from anywhere, instantly. All mod functionality is bundled into a pouch of lodestones that is added to every avatar's inventory when loading a campaign.&#x20;
- [Wifi potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5080) Magical healing potions that look for any available healing potion of the same type in the party's inventory for convenience. No digging through the inventory mid combat, or needing to add potions to the hotbar constantly.
- [Carry Weight Increased - Up To Over 9000](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/522) *Standalone - Pickup and Send Heavy Objects V2*.\
  This will let you pick up objects regardless of weight and send them to camp, it will not allow you to throw items though Strength thresholds still apply for that.
- [Camp Event Notifications](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1879) Displays an exclamation mark above the player character's head, and/or a status when an event is ready to take place upon a full rest. With my configs the annoying exclamation mark is removed by default.

- [Valdacil's Half-Illithid Effect Toggle](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5836) Adds a toggleable ability to any character which evolves to half-Illithid.

- [Auto Send Food To Camp](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6086)&#x20;

</details>

<details><summary>‚ö°Ô∏èbug fixes, tweaks, patches</summary>
### Debugging tools:&#x20;

- [Mod Uninstaller](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9701) For removing items, passives, statuses etc. from mods in your save game.
- [Combat Console Commands](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9282) For debugging combat, unlikely to ever be needed but here it is.

- [Infinite Turn Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11440) Smooth out instances of the game's DM taking a shit.
- [Dialogue Voice Quality Restoration](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8224) *Main* & *Audio*, now only 5GB. Since Patch #6 the audio quality has been significantly worse, so bad I'll just consider it a bug.

## UI Overhaul

**Most UI changes are for keyboard & mouse, gamepad UI is largely vanilla.**\
Targeted at 1080P-1440P on 24"-27" monitors. Built for 16:9 aspect ratio. Ultrawide works fine too, just a bit of unused space.
UI is contextual, only showing when hovering over the elements, except for the sidebar. Take in the gorgeous environment!
